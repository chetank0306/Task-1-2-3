          Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was elected as India’s 11th president from 2002-2007 and died in 2015 while he was
          delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong at the age of 84.

          The birth anniversary of Dr. Kalam is celebrated as National Innovation Day and World Students’ Day.
          <br>
          He was a highly respected and world-renowned scientist and was known as the ‘People’s President’ due to his
          relentless work to see the nation develop.

          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in Rameswaram on
          Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency, and now in the State of Tamil Nadu.
          After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School in Ramanathapuram, Kalam continued his

          He described his time at DRDO as “This was my first stage, in which I learned leadership from three great
          teachers, Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, Prof Satish Dhawan, and Dr. Brahm Prakash. This was the time of learning and
          acquisition of knowledge for me.”
          <br>

          Dr. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.
          <br>

          In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he was the project director of the
          SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.
          <br>

            The SLV-III successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980.</li>
          <li>He was a pioneer in fiberglass technology and led a young team to initiate this effort in ISRO from
            design, and development leading to the production of composite rocket motor cases.</li>
        </ul>

        He visited NASA facilities in Greenbelt, Maryland’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Hampton, Virginia’s Langley

      <h4>Famous quotes by Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>“Don’t take rest after your first victory because if you fail in the second, more lips are waiting to say
          that
          your first victory was just luck.”</li>
        <li>“Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action.”</li>
        <li>“All of us do not have equal talent. But, all of us have an equal opportunity to develop our talents.”</li>
        <li>“Failure will never overtake me if my definition of succeeding is strong enough.”</li>
